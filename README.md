In order to show my motivation I scraped the web site, and counted the words.

By the way, I used SiteSucker to download the website. You can find the result in the folder "bigabid"

# Conclusions of my analysis


Amoung the most used words, there is "analysis", "meaningful", "complex", "passionate". That's exactly what I want realise.

I want to analyse data, give them a sense, in deep into complex problems with passion. 

I pay attention to 2 of the most used words : "experienced", around 40 times in the web site, and "insights", around 50 times in the web site.

Well, I am not experienced, I am a student. However, according to my analysis, you pay more attention to "insights", and I hope I prove it with that code
